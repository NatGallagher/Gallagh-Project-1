                <h3>Personal</h3>
                <p>I am from Maryville TN and currently live in Knoxville TN. I am married to my amazing wife, Alli Gallagher. She is extremely supportive and knows how to continually make me smile.</p>
                <h3>Education/Career</h3>
                <p>I recieved my undergrad in Music Education from the University of Tennessee. I taught in a private school for 1 year and public school for 6 as a Band Director. I specialized in marching percussion as well as Indoor Percussion. Although I have left the field to pursue the tech world, I still write music for local groups in the area. I have written for bands with 30 member marching bands as well as groups with 180 members. Most of my arragements are with 30 piece percussion sections.</p>
                <h3>Where to go from here?</h3>
                <p>I have left teaching to pursue Software Engineering. My goal is to finish up Software Engineering Bootcamp through the University of Tennessee and get hired fulltime.</p>
                <h3>How I'll work with you!</h3>
                <p>Prices are negotiable! My mission is to make arraging affordable again. Tell me what you need and I got you. Working with me isn't just one phone call at the beginning of your season. My phone will always be on. Need edits at the end of the season? I got you! Need to change an entire section? I got you! It is your group, not mine. Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
